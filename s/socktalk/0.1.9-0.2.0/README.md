 ## Install "socktalk" using pip
 If installing socktalk using pip, create and enter a virtual environment then enter into your terminal:  
 "pip install socktalk"  
 
 You can use the following terminal commands:
 1) "socktalk --ai": Runs the chat server with a connected AI client. Uses gpt-3.5-turbo model by default.
-    You should create an environment file named ".env" in the working directory from which you execute the python
-    commands for the package, in order to adjust the AI modes and chat server settings.
+    You should create an environment file named ".env" in the working directory from which you execute the terminal
+    commands to call the package, in order to adjust the AI modes and chat server settings.
 
-    Below is an example for your .env file. You will need to update the OpenAI chatgpt API key. In order for the API key to function you will need to load at least 5$ of credit on your OpenAI account.
-    The AI client has two modes which can be toggled on or off using "True" or "False". AI response intervals can be adjusted. AI model can be adjusted. Mode2 content can be adjusted. See below for more details.
-
-    ### AI Client Modes:
-   1. Respond every N lines: the bot reads the conversation and responds to the conversation once every N lines
-   2. ‚Å†Respond every N seconds: the bot says something completely new and unrelated every N seconds

 ## Install "socktalk" using pip
 If installing socktalk using pip, create and enter a virtual environment then enter into your terminal:  
 "pip install socktalk"  
 
 You can use the following terminal commands:
 1) "socktalk --ai": Runs the chat server with a connected AI client. Uses gpt-3.5-turbo model by default.
-    You should create an environment file named ".env" in the working directory from which you execute the python
-    commands for the package, in order to adjust the AI modes and chat server settings.
+    You should create an environment file named ".env" in the working directory from which you execute the terminal
+    commands to call the package, in order to adjust the AI modes and chat server settings.
 
-    Below is an example for your .env file. You will need to update the OpenAI chatgpt API key. In order for the API key to function you will need to load at least 5$ of credit on your OpenAI account.
-    The AI client has two modes which can be toggled on or off using "True" or "False". AI response intervals can be adjusted. AI model can be adjusted. Mode2 content can be adjusted. See below for more details.
-
-    ### AI Client Modes:
-   1. Respond every N lines: the bot reads the conversation and responds to the conversation once every N lines
-   2. ‚Å†Respond every N seconds: the bot says something completely new and unrelated every N seconds

-       ### ".env" file example

 ## Python Networking Task: Building a Chat Server and Client
 
 Server
 
 The server should be able to handle multiple clients concurrently. It should be able to receive a message from a client and broadcast it to all other connected clients. The server should use non-blocking sockets and select.select() to handle multiple connections.
```
